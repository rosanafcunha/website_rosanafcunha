It is always a pleasure to talk to the public about echinoderms! I had such a fun time at my first Members' Nights event at the [Field Museum](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/) this week. Seeing the people so engaged, laughing, 
and getting surprised with fun facts about this incredible group makes my heart warm!
