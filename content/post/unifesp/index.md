Very excited to let you know that I was selected for the Technical Research Support position in the project "Monitoring invertebrates, fish and abiotic factors in the 
marine environment of the Alcatrazes Archipelago, north coast of the State of São Paulo", coordinated by the Marine Ecology and Conservation Laboratory at the Federal 
University of São Paulo ([UNIFESP](https://www.unifesp.br/campus/san7/)). Such a wonderful project with an amazing team, can't wait to start it soon!
