Very excited to let you know that I was selected for the Technical Research Support position in the project _Monitoring invertebrates, fish and abiotic factors in the 
marine environment of the Alcatrazes Archipelago, north coast of the State of São Paulo_, coordinated by the Marine Ecology and Conservation Laboratory ([LABECMar](https://www.instagram.com/labecmar_unifesp/?hl=en)) at the Federal University of São Paulo ([UNIFESP](https://www.unifesp.br/campus/san7/)). I am sure it will be a unique opportunity in my career, and I will learn a lot with this new challenge. Such a wonderful project with an amazing team, can't wait to start it soon!
