What great news! My picture made the cover of Vol. 101, Issue 6 of the Journal of the Marine Biological Association ([JMBA](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-marine-biological-association-of-the-united-kingdom)), so happy!!!
In the selected photo, it is possible to observe, in detail, the oral structure of _Narcissia ahearnae_ Pawson, 2007, one of the species I studied during my master's degree at the [MZUSP](https://www.mz.usp.br).
