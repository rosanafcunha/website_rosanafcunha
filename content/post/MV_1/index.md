This weekend I had my first Science Communication experience at the Melbourne Museum. As always, it was a blast to talk to the
public. They were very excited (surprised!) to learn how most of the sea stars eat and how they can see. It was also nice to discuss 
with them about the impact caused by the crown-of-thorns sea star in the Great Barrier Reef, and on how their main predador, the giant triton (sea snail), 
helped to control the sea star poupulation in the past. The kids loved the biscuit sea star (Tosia australis), very common around here in Victoria. 
We also had a coloring table with sea stars drawing for the little ones!
