We had such a wonderful time together in the DigInverts workshop this week in California! Glad to be part of this community, and have the opportunity to 
meet so many nice folks in person. The goal of DigIn project is to document marine biodiversity through digitization of invertebrate collections, improving 
accessibility of marine biodiversity data by more than doubling digitally-accessible records (excluding molluscs) from non-federal collections. If you want to
know more about this initiative, please take a look on the [DigIn](https://www.digin-tcn.org/) website!
