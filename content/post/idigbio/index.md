I just learned that I have been selected for the Introduction to Biodiversity Specimen Digitization Course, powered by the [iDigBio](https://www.idigbio.org/) 
(Integrated Digitized Biocollections). This free, online course is focused on introducing the creation of digital data about biodiversity specimens to those who are 
just beginning this activity. I can't express in words my excitement to receive this great opportunity, and improve my skills in this area!
