[Letters to a Pre-Scientist](https://prescientist.org/) connects students to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) professionals through snail mail to broaden studentsâ€™ awareness of what STEM professionals look like and do at work and inspire all students to explore a future in STEM. It is an amazing project and I am more than honored to be part of this initiative! My pen pal is a 8th grade student from Los Angeles, CA, and I'm looking forward to starting our letters exchanges soon!
