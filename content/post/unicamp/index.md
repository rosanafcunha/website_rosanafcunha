Delighted to have been selected for the extension course "Actions, strategies and techniques to create and maintain scientific zoo collections" at the University of Campinas 
([UNICAMP](https://www.ib.unicamp.br/)), one of the most prominent universities in Brazil! Can't wait to acquire more knowledge in this area, which I've been working 
on for over ten years and always fascinates me; and, of course, meeting many new colleagues who share the same interest.
