Delighted to have been selected for this extension course at the University of Campinas ([UNICAMP](https://www.ib.unicamp.br/)), one of the most prominent universities in Brazil! Can't wait to acquire more knowledge in the area of scientific collections, which I've been working on for over ten years and always fascinates me; and, of course, meeting many new colleagues who share the same interest.
