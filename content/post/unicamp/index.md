Delighted to have been selected for this extension course at the University of Campinas ([UNICAMP](https://www.ib.unicamp.br/)), one of the most prestigious universities in Brazil! Can't wait to acquire more knowledge in this area, which I've been working on for over ten years and always fascinates me; and, of course, meeting many new colleagues.
