It is always a pleasure to talk about these incredible animals! Since I was a child, I have always enjoyed reading news about the animal 
world and nature, and I was impressed by experts speaking about their research subjects. I kept imagining: "Will I one day become one of 
these experts, giving an interview about my work and research?" It has been a long journey, but today I am the scientist explaining sea stars to the general public on a major news site! Another dream come true for little Rosana, I could not be happier with this recognition. Thank you, G1 website for the invitation. Please, take a look in their [article](https://g1.globo.com/sp/campinas-regiao/terra-da-gente/noticia/2024/05/15/copia-de-orgaos-vitais-entenda-o-processo-de-regeneracao-dos-bracos-das-estrelas-do-mar.ghtml) to know more about these fascinating invertebrates!
