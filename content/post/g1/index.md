It's always a pleasure to talk about these incredible animals! Since I was a child, I have always enjoyed reading news about the animal 
world and nature, and I was impressed by experts speaking about their research subjects. I kept imagining: "Will I one day become one of 
these experts, giving an interview about my work and research?" It's been a long journey, but today I'm a scientist explaining sea stars 
to the general public on a major news site! Another dream come true for little Rosana, I couldn't be happier with this recognition. 
Thank you, G1 website for the invitation. Please, take a look in the article in their website to know more about these fascinating 
invertebrates [G1]([https://www.digin-tcn.org/](https://g1.globo.com/sp/campinas-regiao/terra-da-gente/noticia/2024/05/15/copia-de-orgaos-vitais-entenda-o-processo-de-regeneracao-dos-bracos-das-estrelas-do-mar.ghtml))
