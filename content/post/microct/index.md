Today I started to observe the interior of the sea stars using micro-computed tomography (μCT)! I am so excited, and I can't wait to share my results with you soon. It was the method I have found to study the types without damage them, and observe the differences in the organization of the plates on the specimens of the _Narcissia_ with different phenotypes! So cool!
