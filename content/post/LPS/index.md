What a wonderful surprise I received in my email today! I'm so happy for this recognition, but much happier to have participated in this amazing program and to be such 
a great inspiration for my pal! Thank you so much (([Letters to a Pre-Scientist](https://prescientist.org/)) and Mr. Gabriel. Can't wait to sign up again next round!
