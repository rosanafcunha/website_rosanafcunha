In this paper we review the taxonomy of the genus _Narcissia_ from morphological studies. Altogether 370 specimens were analyzed. All morphological structures of taxonomic importance have been illustrated, and, for the first time, the internal characters of this group were studied, from electron microscopy and microtomography! _Narcissia trigonaria_ was redescribed from a large specimen, from the type locality (Bahia, Brazil). _Narcissia ahearnae_ is considered a valid species, and _N. canariensis_ and _N. trigonaria_ distinct entities. _Narcissia gracilis malpeloensis_ is placed into the synonymy of _N. gracilis_. The dataset obtained in this work is by far the most complete acquired for the genus _Narcissia_.
