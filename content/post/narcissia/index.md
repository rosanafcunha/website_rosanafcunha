In this paper we review the taxonomy of the genus _Narcissia_ from morphological studies. Altogether 370 specimens were analyzed. All morphological structures of taxonomic importance have been illustrated, and, for the first time, the internal characters of this group were studied, from electron microscopy and microtomography! The dataset obtained in this work is by far the most complete acquired for the genus _Narcissia_.
