I was invited by Professor Dra. Carla Menegola to give a lecture to undergraduate students at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul ([UFRGS](http://www.ufrgs.br/ufrgs/inicial)), 
Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. I talked about the biology of the echinoderms and their main characteristics. The students were very participative, and said they really enjoyed the talk!
It is very rewarding to prepare a class and receive positive feedbacks from the students, it gives you a lot of encouragement and a sense of accomplishment.
