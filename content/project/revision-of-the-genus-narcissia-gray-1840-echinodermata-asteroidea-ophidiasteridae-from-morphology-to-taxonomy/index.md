Since the taxonomic revision of the Ophidiasteridae by H.L. Clark (1921), in which 20 genera
were recognized as valid, several new genera and species were included in this family, and the
boundaries between some of them became largely arbitrary. This also applies to _Narcissia_ Gray,
1840, whose morphology and taxonomy are still very poorly understood today. The main goals
of this research were: review the taxonomy of the genus _Narcissia_, throughout its range of
distribution, from morphological studies; redescribe and characterize, morphologically, _N_.
_trigonaria_ Sladen, 1889 str. s; characterize, morphologically, _N_. _canariensis_ (d'Orbigny, 1839)
 and _N_. _ahearnae_ Pawson, 2007, the two valid species most similar to _N_.
_trigonaria_; review the
 validity of _N_.
_trigonaria_ var. _helenae_ Mortensen, 1933; review the validity of the _N_. _gracilis
 malpeloensis_ Downey, 1975.
