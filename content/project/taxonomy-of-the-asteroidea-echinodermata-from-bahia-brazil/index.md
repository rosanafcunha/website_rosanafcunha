Located on the northeast coast of Brazil, the Bahia State has the largest coastline of the country (~1,200 km; ~15% of the total coastline). Here, we will provide descriptions of adult and juvenile specimens from Bahia (including illustrations, holotype information, remarks) and an illustrated identification key to all Brazilian species to serve as baseline taxonomic data to improve future research on Brazilian Asteroidea. The work will also includes the conservation status of all species, their anthropogenic uses and biological data from local academic research.
