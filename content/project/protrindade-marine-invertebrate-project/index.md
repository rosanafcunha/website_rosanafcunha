Trindade and Martin Vaz (TMV) is a highly isolated, oceanic volcanic archipelago located approximately 1200 km off
the Brazilian coast and about 4200 km away from the nearest African coast. It has been almost 70 years since the first sea
star, "_Astropecten_ sp.", was recorded from Trindade in 1951. In the following years (1955–1971; 2006) six sea star species
were added to the archipelago’s fauna. After that period, however, research on shallow water echinoderms has not been
conducted in TMV and no further sea star species have been recorded from there since. From 2012 to 2019, 263 day time
 SCUBA diving and intertidal samplings conducted at TMV yielded 91 lots of sea stars in 7 species: _Linckia guildingi_ 
Gray, 1840; _Oreaster reticulatus_ (Linnaeus, 1758); _Astropecten_ aff. _antillensis_ Lütken, 1859; _Copidaster lymani_ A. H.
Clark, 1948; _Luidia alternata alternata_ (Say, 1825); _Mithrodia clavigera_ (Lamarck, 1816); and _Ophidiaster guildingi_
 Gray, 1840. The last five species in this list represent new records to the archipelago, with _C_. _lymani_ also being the first
record of the species in the southwestern Atlantic. Five shallow-water species previously known from TMV have not been
observed in the present survey: _Asterinides folium_ (Lütken, 1860), _Astropecten brasiliensis_ Müller & Troschel, 1842,
 _Astropecten cingulatus_ Sladen, 1883, _Linckia nodosa_ Perrier, 1875, and _Ophidiaster alexandri_ Verrill, 1915. Twelve sea
star species are currently known from shallow waters of TMV ([Cunha et _al_. 2020](https://www.rosanacunha.com/publication/cunha_et_al_2020/)). 

This is contribution number 7 of the ProTrindade Marine Invertebrate Project ([ProTrindade](https://www.marinha.mil.br/secirm/sites/www.marinha.mil.br.secirm/files/publicacoes/protrindade/protrindade-10anos.pdf)).
